# Alexsander Telles  
Senior / Lead Data & AI Engineer  
Generative AI · Data Platforms · End-to-End Systems

I am a Senior / Lead Engineer with strong experience designing and leading **end-to-end data and Generative AI solutions**, from data architecture and orchestration to production-grade APIs and user-facing systems.

My work focuses on **applied Generative AI in real business and regulated environments**, combining LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), intelligent agents and modern data platforms with an emphasis on explainability, governance and long-term maintainability.
